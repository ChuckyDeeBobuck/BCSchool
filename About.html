			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p><b>Wanna Know A Little About Me?</b></p>
			<p><h3>Hi, my name is Ray Wade.  I spent a lot of my life in Anaheim California.  
			I worked at Disneyland for 17 years.  During that time, I went to The Art Institute,
			and received a BS in Game Art and Design.  After graduation, I left Disneyland, and 
			started working in the Video Game Industry.  There I made games for Playstion, Xbox,and 
			Nintendo.  Ironically, I landed here in Washington as a video game design for Disney Interactive.
			Later, I began to make my own games.  I released a game called Pixel Sand on Steam.  Because
			of that game, I became interested in programming.</h3></p>
			<p><h3>Because Washington is so beautiful, I decided to stay here.  I went back to school, and 
			received a Certificate in C#/C++ from Lake Washington Institute.  I decided to continue my 
			education at Bellevue College where I am studying programming.  Currently I am taking 3 classes:</h3></p>
